This routine  estimates the transformation matrix between 3D point cloud in one frame with respect the another coordinate frame
.
The algorithm computes the transformation matrix between two point clouds for example the transformation matrix between model coordinates and robot
base frame. This may help in path and trajectory planning, it can also be used in registration of point cloud in different frame into the frame especially
we can use it in structure from motion in vast scale. 
 Specifically this function computes the transformation matrix between robot and  model coordinates by using pointing laser mounted on the robot.
